# Welcome to Lighthouse Labs!

This is your very first class/lecture. It will help you get acquainted with everything and everyone, as well as set some expectations.

### Topics

You will ...

- Get to know your classmates
- Get to know our staff
- Learn more about the curriculum and our educational approach
- Discuss strategies to be successful in bootcamp

### Details

This will be the introductory session for the cohort.

First, the staff and class will introduce themselves to each other and break the ice. Each of us will talk quickly about:

1. Our name
2. Our background
3. A fun/quirky fact about ourselves

We'll then set expectations about the curriculum both in what to expect and how to approach it. There's a lot to talk about here, so in the interest of time, an even deeper dive into curriculum details will take place during tomorrow's class.
