[Vimeo Video Recording](https://vimeo.com/780856316/221e1b0bd0)

Thank you for joining me for our Q&A session! Watch our session here. We covered some great topics...

- Returning promises (example: our query functions)
- Organizing our application
- Requirements in LightBnB and what they help us learn
- Importance of Git branching and Pull Requests (PRs) in team environments
- Why we use .env in projects
- Making an incredible README.md
  - Include set-up instructions (how to set up the .env, DB, migrations, seeds, npm i, etc.)
  - Document the project's features
  - Consider use of LiceCap or ShareX to get screenshots and GIFs of your best features
- Tips for mid-terms:
  - Identify resources
  - Create an ERD
  - Plan out necessary routes
  - Decide which routes require views
  - Wireframe all views
  - Create the boilerplate for the project together
  - Pull the starter source code
  - Divvy up work into bite-sized features (consider Trello)
  - Create branches per feature
  - Pull-request on feature completion
  - Review and approve (or reject) PR (merges to main)
  - Everyone pulls updated main into their branch to confirm compatibility
  - FOCUS on MVP FIRST! Core features should be priority, extras are stretch!
  - Spend the last day ensuring the merged project works and rehearsing your five (5) minute presentation
  - Take full advantage of your teacher check-ins and the mentor queue to stay on-track
  - More planning means less thinking later in your project... spend days planning!
